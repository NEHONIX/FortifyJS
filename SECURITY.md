## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security

#### üîê Password Hashing

-   **Argon2ID**: Default algorithm (winner of Password Hashing Competition)
-   **Timing-Safe Verification**: Constant-time operations prevent timing attacks
-   **Secure Memory Management**: Automatic memory wiping after operations
-   **Salt Generation**: Cryptographically secure random salts

#### üé≤ Random Number Generation

-   **Entropy Sources**: Multiple high-quality entropy sources
-   **CSPRNG**: Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator
-   **Entropy Monitoring**: Real-time entropy quality assessment
-   **Fallback Mechanisms**: Secure fallbacks for low-entropy environments

#### üîë Key Management

-   **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2, Argon2, and scrypt support
-   **Secure Storage**: Memory protection for sensitive keys
-   **Key Rotation**: Support for key rotation strategies
-   **Zero-Knowledge**: Keys never logged or exposed

### Implementation Security

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Timing Attack Prevention

```typescript
// All password verification uses constant-time comparison
const result = await pm.verify(password, hash);
// Takes same time regardless of password correctness
```

#### üßπ Memory Security

```typescript
// Automatic secure memory wiping
const hash = await pm.hash(password, { secureWipe: true });
// Password buffer is overwritten with random data
```

#### üîç Side-Channel Resistance

-   **Argon2I variant**: Specifically designed for side-channel resistance
-   **Constant-time operations**: All security-critical operations
-   **Memory access patterns**: Uniform memory access patterns

### Development Security

#### üîí Secure Development Lifecycle

-   **Security reviews**: All cryptographic code reviewed
-   **Static analysis**: Automated security scanning
-   **Dependency scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
-   **Penetration testing**: Regular security assessments

#### üß™ Security Testing

```bash
# Run security-focused tests
npm run test:security

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Run static security analysis
npm run security:scan
```

const pm = PasswordManager.getInstance({
    defaultAlgorithm: PasswordAlgorithm.ARGON2ID,
    defaultSecurityLevel: "maximum",
    timingSafeVerification: true,
    secureMemoryWipe: true,
    globalPepper: process.env.FORTIFY_PEPPER, // Add extra secret
});
```

#### Security Headers

```typescript
// Express.js security headers
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
    res.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");
    res.setHeader("X-XSS-Protection", "1; mode=block");
    next();
});
```
